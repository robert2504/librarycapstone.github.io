Hello There

Here are the things accomplished for these week.

* **6-22-2018** - Worked on Documentation for some of the work I have done. Will later put it on GitHub Pages. Documentation is on local machine
but will be pushed to GitHub Pages next week
* **6-23-2018** - Worked on learning `Typescript` since most of the books and examples for `vue.js` are in regular `JavaScript`. The template used for
this project was started with `TypeScript`. Spent time viewing a course on Safari Books called `TypeScript Projects`.
