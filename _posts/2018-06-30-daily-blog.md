Creating GitHub Pages with Jekyll - Part 2

  It is hard to decide how these pages will look and what kind of layout I should have. So many Ideas and time goes by fast.
  I want to do so many things but I have to decide what should be part of the project and what can be left out.

  Todays Ideas:

  * Create the Quick Start Guide here
  * Have a Weekly Blog and a Daily Blog of what I do
  * Select one or two ideas to work on in a day, no more
