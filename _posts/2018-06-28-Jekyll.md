Creating GitHub Pages with Jekyll

I though setting up GitHub pages was going to be easy. All you have to do is check the radio button that says GitHub pages, select your theme and save.

![GitHub Pages]({{ "/assets/images/githubpages01.PNG" | absolute_url }})

Inspecting the pages made me realize that I was not gonna move foward unless I found a way to make them look more professional. That is when I read about Jekyll.


` Some code would go here`

:-)

If I want to use jekyll and host pages on my laptop I have to know ruby. More languages? Maybe next year

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
